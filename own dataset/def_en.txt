 Stuttering is when my words get stuck like I just did. Stuttering is not something that you can help, it's something that just cc comes along with some people. I get worried like what other people might think if I I I do stutter. Kids should ignore the people who teache them about ss stuttering because it's not their fault. I worry about it when I'm on S words and they always get me stuck on stuff and words with an S W-T-O-U-T-E-R-S at the begginning.Help us help those who stutter.
