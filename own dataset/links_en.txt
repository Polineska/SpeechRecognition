Firstly, Netflix is well-known for weird rules. 
To begin with the company offers unlimited vacation for employees, who have a child. Moreover, the Netflix director takes 6 weeks off every year to spend time with his family, and encourages his employees to do the same.In addition, employees can visit the Netflix cinema during the working day. Hence, he workers can watch a new movie and series before official realise at the cinema.
So, the company allows employees to take as much vacation as they want, provided that the work is done. Particularly, Netflix company considers that this policy  improves work-life balance and mood, reducing stress and increases people's energy. Althought, people work more efficiently after a rest. I would like to work for the company with the same rules.  So, that's why I chose to speak about Netflix company.
